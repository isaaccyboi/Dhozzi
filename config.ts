// In a real production app, this would be loaded from an environment variable
// for security and flexibility. For example:
// export const BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || '';

// For this project, we'll keep it simple.
// An empty string '' makes requests relative to the current host,
// which works perfectly with our mock server.
// To connect to a live backend, you would change this to the server's URL.
// e.g., export const BASE_URL = 'https://your-dhozzi-backend.com';

export const BASE_URL = '';
